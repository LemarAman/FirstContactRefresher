# FirstContactRefresher

Requirements:
Windows,
Chrome,
AutoHotKey

This script automatically will refresh your first contact page every minute for 9 hours. 
If an agent has a new first contact, there will be a visual notification in terms of a pop up prompting the agent to go to their first contact page. There will also be an audio cue.
The first contact page is confined to the top left corner and below all other windows while it constantly refreshes and scans the page. If you close the first contact page, the script notifies you and prompts you to reopen it, so the script can continue working as intended.

Run the file as an administrator so the blockinput command works properly. Blocking the input while it scans the page ensures no interferance while doing other business on the PC.
